How to play
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 Use the arrows to move, the X/Y Buttons to jump, and the A/B buttons to throw rocks. 

 When you move, you consume energy. You can replenish it by grabbing
 the fruit located throughout the levels. If you run out, you're dead!

 In each level, you're being chased by a giant lawn mower. Don't let
 him catch up with you, or you're mince meat!
 
 Other hazards include gophers, fish, frogs, carnivorous plants, pits,
 spikes, and much much mor... well not really. Bonk everything that
 moves with your trusty infinite supply of rocks.
 
Hints
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 * Many of the levels seem atrociously difficult. That's because they
   are. But there are very simple ways to get through them. When you're 
   playing, notice there are some places where you can just run right through, 
   others where you can run right through by simply mashing the throw button,
   and sometimes simply timing a jump + throw combo carefully. Pay attention 
   to the level design and baddie patterns. Learn the tricks, and have fun! 
   You'll be a pro in no time.
   
 * Is the wall jumping annoying you? Make sure you're pushing against the
   wall, then wait till you start descending - that's when you latch
   on to it. Once you do, quickly press the jump button repeatedly and
   you'll fly up the wall!
